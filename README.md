# American Box

A simple Arabic storefront for imported supplements and vitamins. The repository contains a single `index.html` page styled with basic CSS. You can open the file directly in any modern browser.

Product images currently use placeholder links hosted on GitHub. Replace these URLs with your own images or place your files in an `img/` directory and update the paths accordingly.

To view the page locally:

```bash
# clone the repository
# then open index.html
open index.html
```

The archive of `nanorc` syntax files has been removed since it was unrelated to the project.
